This fork is an attempt to make v249 work with some of the more modern shaders. 
I had no idea how hard it would be to get this to compile with the https changes, so the gradle setup is a mess, and I have a bazillion commits. 

But on the bright side, the build/package system is working now, so I can actually start on the changes I wanted to make. The changes themselves are not working yet though, sp do not use it - you will either see no difference, or it will outright break until I've had some more time with it.
