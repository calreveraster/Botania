Made several changes so that I dont need to be moving files back and forth between github because I'd rather just edit in one place. 
Is that terible form? Yes. Is it easier? Also yes. 

• Created github build setup
• Created github package creator 
• Threw build.gradle against a wall and threatened it angrily until it complied
• Did the same to to the new build.yml file
• Created a few directories and moved several dependencies to be local files due to http changes 
• Got a successful compile
